### Twitter Reader

I'm making a really simple twitter reader to help me learn React (and because I really want a better way to track certain things I'm interested in on Twitter).

To set it up, clone it, `npm install`, and update the `twitter.json.example` file with your Twitter API keys and rename it to `twitter.json`.
